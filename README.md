# snake
Classic snake game.

Learning game dev with Python and pygame.

## roadmap

- snake dies when hits wall
- snake dies when size < 1 (from bad apples)
- short sounds: pause, eat good, eat bad, get ready, level finished. music: intro, lose, win
- feature list, install instructions and demo gif in readme, binary package on github releases
- credits screen after winning

### issues
- pause/unpause background music
