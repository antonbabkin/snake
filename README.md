# snake
Classic snake game.

Learning game dev with Python and pygame.

## roadmap

- different sprite for head, shows facing direction
- status bar: size, speed, score, fps
- when starting, snake does not move until direction pressed
- first screen with instructions
- levels: start from minimal size and speed, increase speed and restart when max size reached
- game over screen: show stats, press any key to restart
- you win screen: show stats, press any key to restart
- snake changes color as speed increases, from blue to red
- key to toggle grid lines
- good and bad apples: good grow, bad shrink
