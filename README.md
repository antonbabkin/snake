# snake
Classic snake game.

Learning game dev with Python and pygame.

## roadmap

- status bar: size, speed, score, fps
- first screen with instructions
- levels: start from minimal size and speed, increase speed and restart when max size reached
- snake changes color as speed increases, from blue to red
- good and bad apples: good grow, bad shrink
- visuals: tune colors, add images


## issues

- shrink all sprites a little so that they do not cover grid lines
- win screen: any key takes to next level, lose screen: any key restarts game
